# SkillKernel TaskFlow Ledger

Managed durable work item: `skillkernel-autoskill-v1`

Goal: implement OpenClaw AutoSkill Manager from the v9 closed-design handoff until production acceptance criteria are satisfied.

Owner: Claudia front-stage; `codex-worker` may be used for bounded coding/debugging slices.

Canonical path: `/Warehouse/SkillKernel`

Guiding document: `openclaw-autoskill-ultimate-v9-closed-design-handoff.md`

## Current Phase

Phase 0/1 bootstrap.

## Current State

- Project directory created.
- Handoff saved and checksum-verified.
- Project-local `AGENTS.md` added.
- Initial sidecar, migration, plugin skeleton, and deterministic primitive tests are created and committed.
- Python tests pass.
- Python compile check passes.
- Plugin JavaScript syntax and Node spool tests pass.
- DB-backed event ingest is implemented with workspace upsert and `raw_events.event_id` idempotency.
- Sidecar ingest supports optional bearer-token auth.
- OpenClaw plugin spool replay and byte-bound compaction are implemented.
- Hook-package smoke tests import actual handlers, verify OpenClaw event metadata, and prove redacted envelope forwarding.
- Real local Postgres validation passed via compose: migration applied, first ingest accepted, duplicate ingest deduped, payload stored redacted.
- Plugin diagnostics report sidecar reachability/status and spool file/byte counts.
- Sidecar job queue primitives are implemented: idempotent enqueue, lease claim, completion, status counts, and expired-lease recovery.
- Real local Postgres job validation passed via compose: duplicate enqueue returned existing job, claim leased a job, completion marked success, expired lease was recovered and reclaimed.
- Sidecar scheduler tick primitive is implemented: due schedules enqueue idempotent jobs and advance `next_run_at`.
- Real local Postgres scheduler validation passed via compose: first tick enqueued one due job, second tick produced no duplicate, and the schedule advanced.
- Sidecar evidence derivation primitive is implemented: redacted raw events become observed `event_observation` evidence items with source-event provenance.
- Real local Postgres evidence validation passed via compose: first event ingest accepted, duplicate ingest deduped, first derive created one observed item, second derive produced no duplicate, and the evidence payload remained redacted.
- Retrieval schema support is implemented for body index documents, `vector(1536)` embedding records, lexical indexes, HNSW vector index, and retrieval logs.
- Deterministic lexical retrieval API is implemented for evidence/body-index records.
- Real local Postgres retrieval validation passed via compose: migration applied, evidence derived, lexical query found an evidence candidate, and a retrieval log row was written.
- Embedding upsert/search primitives are implemented with fixed `vector(1536)` dimension validation, finite-value checks, all-zero rejection, and pgvector cosine nearest search.
- Real local Postgres embedding validation passed via compose: migration applied, two non-zero embeddings inserted, nearest search returned both, and cosine ordering was correct.
- OpenClaw simple-plugin validator is not applicable to this hook plugin shape; Phase 0 still needs an installed-plugin smoke test against the live gateway.

## Next Gates

1. Confirm exact OpenClaw hook event names and return contracts with an installed-plugin smoke test.
2. Add embedding generation workers over evidence/body-index text.
3. Add context-broker data access and set-aware context rendering.
4. Add worker loop dispatch with risk/cost pool separation.
5. Add retry backoff and terminal failure policy for jobs.

## Known Risks

- Hook event names are currently scaffolded from local code inspection and must be confirmed with an installed plugin smoke test before relying on capture coverage.
- Spool replay is best-effort from capture hooks and still needs a live gateway smoke test under actual hook concurrency.
- Message hook event aliases remain intentionally broad until live OpenClaw installed-plugin validation confirms current names.
- The dev compose Postgres volume is persistent; rerun migrations are intended to be idempotent.
- Job completion currently records terminal success/failure; retry backoff policy beyond expired-lease recovery is still pending.
- Evidence derivation currently creates one observed item per captured event; higher-maturity recurring/contrastive/intervention evidence still needs aggregation logic.
- Retrieval has lexical and vector storage/search primitives, but no embedding-generation worker is wired yet.
